# Directory structure #

An organised directory structure will work wonders when it comes to looking for files you haven't been working on for a while. Think about a hierarchical structure that could be repeated across your work.

A good example can be seen here.

Some handy tips:

    don't use spaces or special characters in directory names, instead split the sections using underscores ( _ ) or dashes ( - ) and words within sections using CamelCaps (starting each word with a capital letter). This can help with readability.
    keep names short but meaningful: some file systems have limits on the number of characters in a full directory path so if you have several sub-directories this can become a problem.
    avoid using acronyms.
    your directories will be listed in alphabetical order. It is more useful to others looking for files to not have prefixes such as numbers or letters that order your directories.
    if you are going to be storing millions of files, consider more hierarchical directories such as YYYY/MM/DD/yyyymmdd_data_file_name.

## readme.txt ##

Always include a readme file within a directory to describe its contents. This will help anyone coming to look at the files in the future, and will help jog your memory.

The Gurdon Institute provides a very useful list of what to include here, summarised as follows:

    - summarise what is in the directory
    - use keywords for the project, data type or parameters so that they can be searched in the future
    - include the name of the person(s) who created the directory and their contact details
    - describe any changes made to the directory and when
    - make sure the file is written in text format (.txt) so that it can easily be read in the future.

If you would like to write with formatting and equations, Markdown is a useful convention that can be used. Pandoc is a very useful tool to then convert Markdown into different file formats such as html, PDF etc. as you so wish. Remember to save the readme in text format though!
