Metadata is the "data that provides information about the data" (Merriam Webster, 2020).

Without information about how data and samples were collected, final results cannot be interpreted correctly (Smith et al., 2015). Metadata is also documentation that is a reminder to your future self (and others) of what your data or samples are. 

Will you remember in 10 years what a particular acronym was? Do you remember why a sample was collected in an unexpected location? Would someone else know that a set of particular air filters may have picked up abnormally high levels of a particular particle because at the time you passed through a plume of smoke?  

## How is metadata used? ##

**For yourself:** 

Metadata serves as a **useful reminder** from the inception of a project, right through its lifetime and well into the future, of how, why, when, where and by whom, data or samples were collected, how they have been transformed and include any information that may affect their state. 

Think also of **reproducibility**: for publications it is likely you will need to write detailed methods of how you have reached your results. Keeping these notes as you go is vital and will save you a lot of time and uncertainty of remembering all the details when you come to write up at the end of a project.

**For others:**

If you are **collaborating** with others, it is likely that they will need to access your data or work on data resulting from samples at some point. Having metadata readily available ensures they are able to interpret and use the data in a suitable way. If your samples or data are part of a larger project, the person compiling all of the results will need to know where and when they were collected to give context as well. Of course they may still have questions, but why not add your response to the metadata and keep improving it for future users?

Metadata allows not only you but others to **interpret and understand** your findings. 

**Validation** of datasets as part of the publication review process is becoming the norm. 

It is often a requirement of funders, and is good practice, to **publish your dataset** so that it is available for other researchers and the general public. Many platforms or repositories that provide these publishing services require a certain amount of metadata to ensure that your dataset is discoverable. It is also in your interest to give as much information as possible so that a future user properly understands the suitability of the dataset for their purposes as well as its limitations. Giving a good description of the dataset means a potential user is much more likely to use it in the future. In addition to possible citations arising from sharing datasets in the first place, research has shown that citing datasets clearly in a publication lead to more citations and goes some way to giving further credibility to a publication because it is more reproducible (Colavizza et al., 2020). 

Of course there may be others who would like to do a **similar study* or try to **replicate your results**.

## Levels of metadata ##

**Samples**

* Details of how they were collected. Include where, when, by whom, methods, particular conditions that might affect their collection or resulting data. Also note specific details of any instruments (include manufacturer, version, serial number).
* Details of how they are processed. Include who did the processing, what instrument, techniques, protocols, guides and standards were used. Also note where, when and specific details of any instruments (include manufacturer, version, serial number).
* Record how the samples were stored and what happened to them between collection and processing. 
* Record where they are stored (or if they were destroyed as part of the processing). 
* Don't forget to include information about any supporting datasets that may have been collected at the time of sample collection or storage, as well as details of where output datasets can be found.

Ideally someone should be able to follow their whole life history from collection to data and be able to find them in their final resting place (or know that they no longer exist).

## Machine-readable metadata ##

If we structure and document our data correctly, it can be easily read by machines (i.e computers). It is important for humans to be able to understand if a dataset is fit for their purpose, something normally achieved by reading documentation. However it is possible to make metadata machine-readable as well to ensure that datasets are more easily findable in searches, are easier to combine with other datasets and also meet community standards to be able to compare like-for-like more easily.
