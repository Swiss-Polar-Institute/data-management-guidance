# Data file formats #

Non-proprietary data file formats help to ensure the longevity of datasets (Borer et al., 2009). Text files such as comma-separated values (csv) are well-documented, easy to read by a variety of software and will be readable in the future. Using file formats that are specific to a certain piece of software, such as Excel files, have a higher probability of becoming unreadable in the future. As software versions change, they are not always backwards compatible, meaning that a file produced ten years ago may no longer be readable. Trends also change and now common software applications may not be widely used in the future.

Consider storing any documentation about your data files in plain text files (.txt) that are very future proof.
