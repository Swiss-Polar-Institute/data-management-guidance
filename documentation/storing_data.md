# Storing data # 

Storing your data in an organised and secure manner, will save you a lot of time and hassle in the long run. It is worth investing time and effort in ensuring a coherent [directory structure](directory_structure.md), understandable [file names](file_naming.md), secure data storage and carefully thought-out [backups](backing_up_data.md).

In this section we focus on where to store your data. Suggestions are <em>not</em> ordered by preference.

## What to consider ##

Thinking carefully about what you need to be able to do with your data will help you to select where is best to store your data.

* What do you want to do with the data? 
* Do other people need access to your data?
* What is the volume of your data?
* How long do you want to use the particular storage for?

## Types of storage media ##

Remember that for [backups](backing_up_data.md) of data, it is important to have them in multiple places and on different types of media. Different types of media offer solutions to different problems and therefore you will need to consider using more than one. 

### Institutional data storage ###

* Often, but not always backed up regularly (check this!), this is often a handy place to store your data for easy access. 
* It is worth checking if it is easy to allow external collaborators to access your data, although this is more often done through other means. 
* Check what limits there are on the volume of storage: if you are collecting large volumes of data, you may need to budget for asking them for more data storage.
* Consider that you may need to access the data from off-site from time to time and find out early on how to do this. Make sure it works, there is nothing worse than trying to access data (or other file) that you need in a hurry and not have what you need set up properly.

### Your computer's hard drive ###

* If you do any work on your local hard drive, make sure that you back it up on a regular basis. 

### Portable media ###

Portable hard drives are commonly used for backing up data in the field or as one of the means of backing up data. 

* Buy reputable makes of hard drives. If you are going to use a lot of them (for example, during a particular field season), by at least two different makes to avoid buying a "bad" batch. 
* Consider buying several medium-sized hard drives rather than one large one. If one fails, at least you do not lose everything.
* Take care of hard drives: remember that they are susceptible to physical damage and depending on how many times you write to them, may only last a few years.
* Pendrives are easy to lose and shouldn't be considered as reliable for data backup. 

### Cloud storage ###

Cloud storage is becoming the norm in many cases, particularly where the data volume is getting into hundreds of GBs. There are many types of cloud storage that you can set up yourself or buy as a managed service, but there are a few considerations to take into account.

* The physical location of the cloud storage can have implications for data access, storage of personal data and requirements that may come from your funders.
* Some cloud storage providers charge not only for the data storage, but also for the number and size of copying data to and from the storage. It is important to think about how this could impact on your costs.
* Some providers provide different levels of storage: consider if you want to have immediate access to your data or if you are happy to have it in "cold storage" where it may take a while to access it - this is often a low-cost option and good for long-term backups of data that you are not actively working on.
* For managed systems, make sure that backups are done regularly.
* For unmanaged systems, check how you will be able to copy and access data. Many systems require the use of command-line tools.
