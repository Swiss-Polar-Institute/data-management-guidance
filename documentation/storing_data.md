# Storing data # 

Storing your data in an organised and secure manner, will save you a lot of time and hassle in the long run. It is worth investing time and effort in ensuring a coherent [directory structure](directory_structure.md), understandable [file names](file_naming.md), secure data storage and carefully thought-out [backups](backing_up_data.md).

In this section we focus on where to store your data. Suggestions are *not* ordered by preference.

## What to consider when deciding where to store your data ##

Thinking carefully about what you need to be able to do with your data will help you to select where is best to store your data.

* What do you want to do with the data? 
* Do other people need access to your data?
* What is the volume of your data?
* How long do you want to use the particular storage for?
* What budget do you have for data storage?
* Are your data sensitive?

## Types of storage media ##

Remember that for [backups](backing_up_data.md) of data, it is important to have them in multiple places and on different types of media. Different types of media offer solutions to different problems and therefore you will need to consider using more than one. 

### Networked data storage ###

* Often, but not always backed up regularly (check this!), this is often a handy place to store your data for easy access. 
* Check access rights: would you have a personal area of data storage, or would it be shared amongst your lab or a wider group? Think if you need the data to have restricted access, particularly if it is sensitive (protected species) or contains personal data. Access should also be limited to avoid changing or deleting files accidentally. Make sure that primary raw data are read-only.
* It is worth checking if it is easy to allow external collaborators to access your data, although this is more often done through other means. 
* Check what limits there are on the volume of storage: if you are collecting large volumes of data, you may need to budget for asking them for more data storage.
* Consider that you may need to access the data from off-site from time to time and find out early on how to do this. Make sure it works, there is nothing worse than trying to access data (or other file) that you need in a hurry and not have what you need set up properly.

### Personal computers ###

Storing data on your personal computer or laptop is not recommended. Failure of the hard disk, theft or damage to the computer itself could mean loss of all the data. If using a personal computer to work on data, ensure that you have a master copy backed up elsewhere, that you work on a *copy* of the [raw data](working_on_data.md) and that any work you do is backed up on a regular basis. 

### Portable media ###

Portable hard drives are commonly used for [backing up](backing_up_data.md) data in the field but their use-case should be carefully considered. Some portable media types are not useful for long-term storage because they quickly degrade or become obsolete. 

* Buy reputable makes of portable hard drives. If you are going to use a lot of them (for example, during a particular field season), by at least two different makes to avoid buying a "bad" batch. 
* Consider buying several medium-sized hard drives rather than one large one. If one fails, at least you do not lose everything.
* Take care of hard drives: remember that they are susceptible to physical damage and depending on how many times you write to them, may only last a few years.
* Pendrives are easy to lose and shouldn't be considered as reliable for data backup. 
* USB-3 devices offer faster speeds for copying data.
* If a hard drive is lost, it can be easily read by anyone. The hard drive should be encrypted if it holds any personal or sensitive data.
* Regularly check any data that are held on portable media to ensure it can still be read. Always have other backups. 

### Cloud storage ###

Cloud storage is becoming the norm in many cases, particularly where the data volume is getting into hundreds of GBs. There are many types of cloud storage that you can set up yourself or buy as a managed service, but there are a few considerations to take into account.

* If you are storing personal data, it is essential to understand the location of the physical servers and ensure this complies with regulations.
* Access rights are also important. Consider who might have access to the data, if you use read-only or write access rights and where the data are physically stored.
* Check the privacy policy carefully. 
* Some cloud storage providers charge not only for the data storage, but also for the number and size of copying data to and from the storage. It is important to think about how this could impact on your costs.
* Some providers provide different levels of storage: consider if you want to have immediate access to your data or if you are happy to have it in "cold storage" where it may take a while to access it - this is often a low-cost option and good for long-term backups of data that you are not actively working on.
* For managed systems, make sure that backups are done regularly.
* For unmanaged systems, check how you will be able to copy and access data. Many systems require the use of command-line tools.
* Speed of access to data (particularly when more than a few GBs) can be limited by your bandwidth - consider how you will access large volumes of data carefully.
* Always check that you are able to move your data to another provider at a reasonable cost and in a reasonable time manner. This could happen if there are changes to the services that are provided, they go out of service or they no longer meet the requirements you need. Some providers may use proprietary formats which might make moving the data impossible.
* Ensure the subscription is always maintained (if paid for) otherwise you may find your data are deleted.  

Wikipedia has a very handy [comparison of online backup options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_backup_services). These would not normally be used for your day-to-day data storage for the data you are working on.
