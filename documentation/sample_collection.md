## Collecting samples

Obtaining accurate results from your experiment when analysing samples, depends on "proper collection, processing and handling of samples" (Smith et al., 2015), planning for which begins before sample collection. 

Our main aims when considering good practise for collection of samples are: 
* accurate labelling of samples;
* quickly identifying or finding a sample;
* matching it to any documentation or metadata about how it was collected.

Here we focus on numbering samples and recording information about their collection.

### Numbering samples

Carefully planned sample numbers will make it much easier to meet our aims above. Keep numbers as simple as possible to avoid mistakes and confusion.

#### Requirements from other partners
 
If your samples belong to a larger project, make yourself aware of any requirements that should be met. All projects will need to ensure that sample numbers are unique, therefore you might be required to add a specific prefix or suffix to identify your samples from those of another part of the project.

The laboratory or organisation where the samples are going to be stored and / or analysed may also have their own requirements for numbering. 

Making yourself aware of these requirements in advance will make sure you are not caught out having to make amendments not only to the numbers written on the samples themselves, but your documentation and metadata as well. 

#### Unique identification number for each sample

Each sample should have a unique identification number written on it - don't just write a short version of a longer sample number that could easily be confused if more than one sample from your field campaign (or the wider project) may end up with the same number.

This unique identification number will then "link" that physical sample to the information that is recorded about its collection ([metadata](#recording-information-about-sample-collection-metadata)).

#### Duplicate samples

In some experiments, more than one sample will be taken at the same time and under the same conditions in order to corroborate results. These samples may be known as "duplicates" (or "triplicates" in the case of three, and so on). It is important to be able to distinguish between these samples.

#### Further considerations

* The space that you have on your sample container.
* You might be able to label containers before sample collection - be very aware of mistakes that can be made if for some reason you need to put a sample in the "wrong" or a "wrongly labelled" container.
* Some groups may use a barcoding system to record and label samples. There are various costs associated with setting up and maintaining such a system, but it may be worth consideration and the investment if you are going to be collecting thousands of samples (Copp et al., 2014).  

### Labelling

Label containers directly using permanent waterproof marker pens, or on an adhesive label where necessary. Never solely label the cap of a container: the body of the container should always be the primary label (Smith et al., 2015).

For very small containers, it might be necessary to place the label on a small piece of appropriate material (to ensure neither the sample nor the label are damaged) inside the container.

If working with alcohol for sample preservation, use pencil to label your samples. 

Carefully consider how your samples are going to be stored and transported to make sure they will not come into contact with any chemicals or conditions that may damage the labelling.

### Recording information about sample collection ([metadata](#metadata))

Without [information about how, where and when samples are collected, stored, processed and curated](#metadata), it is not possible to interpret results correctly. Recording this information, known as [*metadata*](#metadata), is essential and should be considered as the important as the samples themselves.

Recording sample contents is essential: this information may be required by permitting authorities and border control when transporting samples back for analysis.
