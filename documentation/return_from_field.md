## Upon your return

When returning from the field, data management **priorities** are to: 

* backup data (data, metadata and documentation) to networked (or other suitable) storage: ensure the primary copy is read-only;
* ensure safe storage of samples;
* ensure safe storage of hand-written notes.

**Further considerations** will then be to: 

* check metadata and documentation and add any extra information whilst it is still fresh;
* document clearly where data are backed up and how they can be accessed;
* organise a **copy** of the raw data where it can be [worked on](#working-on-your-data).

Follow the guide to [working on data](#working-on-your-data) to follow best practice.
