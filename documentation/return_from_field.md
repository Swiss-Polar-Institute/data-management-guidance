## Upon your return

When returning from the field, data management **priorities** would be to: 

* backup data (data, metadata and documentation) to networked storage: ensure the primary copy is read-only;
* ensure safe storage of samples;
* ensure safe storage of hand-written notes.

**Further considerations** will then be to: 

* check metadata and documentation and add any extra information whilst it is still clear in your mind;
* document clearly where your data are backed up and how they can be accessed;
* organise a **copy** of your data in an area where you are able to [work on it](#working-on-your-data).
