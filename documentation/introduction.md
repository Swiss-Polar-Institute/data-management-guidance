### Benefits of good data management

Setting time aside for carefully managing data and samples from the beginning of a project, will save a lot of time in the long run. Investment of time in good preparation and management of data files, software, documentation and associated files is an investment for the future. Detailed documentation, organised files and well-kept backups will make life a lot easier for your future self and others.

### What this guide covers

In this guide we cover good research data management practice with a focus on field work, although the general guidelines are applicable in any circumstances. The first part of the guide is general and can be applied throughout all stages of the research lifecycle. 

The second part is a guide for data management in the field and is broken into three sections: planning data management for fieldwork, some key points to remember whilst in the field and a brief set of considerations for returning to your institution. We regularly refer back to the key sections of the first part of the document and recommend that the reader is familiar with this before reading the field guide.

#### Scope

Research data includes raw data directly recorded by hand or from an instrument, processed data which are any files that have been modified, documentation, metadata, supporting data files, code, plots and any other files associated with your research. 

This guide is applicable to all file types and "kinds" of data. 

We also consider good practice of sample collection from a data management point of view. This section has a particular focus on numbering and collection of metadata about samples.

Finally, we consider field work, and more precisely polar field work (although the same principles apply anywhere) in the broad sense of not working at your institution. It could be at a field camp, on a well-established base, on a ship or any other platform, the remote operation of an instrument and wherever else you might be taken by your research.
