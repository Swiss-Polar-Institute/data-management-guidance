## Benefits of good data management ##

Setting time aside for carefully managing data and samples from the beginning of a project, will save a lot of time in the long run. Investment of time in good preparation and management of data files, software, documentation and associated files is an investment for the future. Detailed documentation, organised files and well-kept backups will make life a lot easier for your future self and others.

## What this guide covers ##

In this guide we cover good research data management practice with a focus on field work, although the general guidelines are applicable in any circumstances. We look at planning before field work, time when in the field and a brief set of considerations for returning to your institution. 

The second part of the guide has sections about different aspects of data management which are often referred to from the first part. These sections are applicable throughout all aspects of fieldwork, but also at any other time and can be used as a general guide.

### Scope ###

Research data includes raw data (directly recorded by hand or from an instrument), processed data (any files that have been modified in any way), documentation, metadata, supporting data files, code, plots and any other files associated with your research. 

This guide is applicable to all file types and "kinds" of data. 

We also consider good practice (from a data management point of view) of sample collection. This section has a particular focus on numbering and collection of metadata about samples.
