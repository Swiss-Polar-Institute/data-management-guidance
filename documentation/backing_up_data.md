# Data backup #

Ensuring you have several reliable copies of your data avoids data loss and gives you peace of mind. Think carefully about the type of [data storage](storing_data.md) you use for your backups.

Make sure:
 * you have at least two, preferably three or more copies of your data;
 * data are backed up on at least two different [types of media](storing_data.md), particularly for preservation purposes;
 * that as far as possible, backups are automated. This avoids potential mistakes, minimises the chances of data loss, makes it much easier to do (it is less of a chore) and ensures the backups are always done in the same way;
 * data are backed up on a regular basis, but particularly during collection and after making any changes;
 * data copies are in different places, eg. institution storage, cloud storage, external hard drives;
 * the devices you use are reliable;
 * that backed up versions of your data are identical to the primary copy. Whilst checking that files have been copied, even if they are listed in the secondary location, using checksums will confirm they have been copied correctly;
 * that you can easily restore your backups.

## Documenting backups ##
It is important to document where the files have been backed up, when, how often, as well as how they can be accessed and restored if necessary. Think of this as a backup for your future self - it might be a whole field season before you look back at how you organised the backups, so after a long time away, it is useful to pick up a short README file with this information and be able to restore backed-up data straight away.

## Handy tips ##
Decide on a directory structure and file naming convention for your data and stick to it. Making changes to these (unless absolutely necessary) can create havoc with backups because it is easy to lose track of what has been copied and what hasn't, which is the latest version and so on.
