# Field guide 

## Introduction

This section provides a guide to good data management for undertaking fieldwork. It is split into three distinct sections: planning before you go, whilst in the field, and things to consider upon your return from the field. 

Within in each section, we consider whether you will be collecting data from an instrument, data by hand or collecting samples and have sets of key points to think about. 

The field guide often refers to the earlier part of this document for information or guidance on a particular topic, such as data storage media. We assume you are familiar with these earlier sections and recommend returning to the relevant sections when you come across these references to have a full grasp of the context.
