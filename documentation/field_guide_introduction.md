# Field guide 

## Introduction

This section provides a guide to good data management whilst in the field. It is split into three distinct sections: planning beforehand, whilst in the field, and things to consider upon return from the field. 

Within in each section, we consider whether data are being collected from an instrument or by hand, and the collection of samples. 

The field guide often refers to the earlier part of this document for information or guidance on a particular topic. We assume the reader is familiar with these earlier sections and recommend returning to the relevant sections when coming across these references to have a full grasp of the context.
