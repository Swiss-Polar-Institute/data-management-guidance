## In the field

### Data collection from an instrument

Whenever data is collected from an instrument, automation and careful setup are key. Much of your setup for [data storage](storing_data.md) should already be planned and in place before you begin work in the field. Refer to the [planning](planning_before_go.md) section for what to think about and prepare before you arrive in the field.

#### Initial setup and testing

Retaining data and keeping careful notes ([metadata](metadata.md) about initial setup and tests in the field is essential in case you notice any problems later on.

Firstly check that you can read a data file. If files are saved in proprietary formats, then make sure you have access to the software you need to be able to check them carefully.

Check that data files contain data for the parameters you expect in the correct units. Ensure the files are being saved in the [directory structure](directory_structure.md) and with the [filenames](file_naming.md) that you expect. Now is the time to make any necessary changes.

#### Periodic checking of data

If you are able to access your data whilst in the field, this will give you a great advantage of being able to check files are being saved correctly.

If data is being recorded continuously, it would be good practise to check them at least once a day, or more often if time allows. Events such as bad weather may mean you need to check the data more regularly.

Check that the data files are being saved correctly and that you can read them. If you are able to visualise your data in some way, this is a very nice way to spot anomalies in the data which may in turn help you spot an instrument problem which you might subsequently be able to fix to get your data collection back on track.

#### [Backups](backing_up_data.md)

[Backups](backing_up_data.md) should be automated wherever possible. If this is not possible, make sure they are done on at least a daily basis and in more than one place.

Check the integrity of your backups on a regular basis: make sure the files backed up are the same as the originals and that you can read them correctly.

#### Handy tips

* Unless you have forgotten (or would like to add) a parameter, do not change what is collected in a data file part way through a field campaign. This adds much unneeded complexity and confusion when trying to read the data files during the post-processing stages. In particular, do not change the format of fields or parameter names.

### Recording data by hand

If collecting data in a notebook by hand, it is good practise to digitise the data as soon as possible - ideally this should be done the same day. This gives you firstly a backup of your data in case the unthinkable happens and you lose your notebook. It also means you can embellish any shorthand you have used before you forget what it means, or follow up on anything you needed to query. In particular in cases where you might be recording species observed for example, you can follow up on ID before you forget what your notes referred to.

#### [Backing up](backing_up_data.md) or digitising your data

These digitised data files should be considered as any other data file: consider the [file name](file_naming.md), [directory structure](directory_structure.md) and [backups](backing_up_data.md).

If adding to a data file with new observations, using the date to denote different versions of the file is helpful eg., project_datatype_observations_YYYYMMDD.csv

### [Sample collection](sample_collection.md)

The main thing to remember regarding [sample collection](sample_collection.md) is to record [metadata](metadata.md) about its collection as accurately and as soon as possible. Cross-checking this information is handy to avoid mistakes during long work days.

Ensure you are able to find samples easily from your records, particularly if you are participating in a long field campaign.

Finally, keep an accurate record of what is contained in each sample according to any permits and border entry requirements. It is particularly helpful to note which storage container samples are stored in, in case you need to find them quickly for customs. Also be sure to note if they are destroyed during any sample analysis that you undertake whilst in the field: you don't want to be searching for a sample that no longer exists!

### Data from sample analysis

In some cases, you might collect samples in the field and then process them whilst still away from your home laboratory. If using instrumentation to process samples, please refer to the section about [data collection from an instrument](#data collection from an instrument).

Your field setup will very much dictate how you are able to record data from sample analysis. If you have to record numerical values from processing consider if you will be able to have a laptop or computer in the lab, or if will you be noting the values by hand. If the former, then treat this as [data collection from an instrument](#data collection from an instrument), taking good care to regularly save and backup data files. If the latter, then refer to the section, [recording data by hand](#recording data by hand). This data should be digitised as soon as possible and backed up securely.

If recording further information about the samples such as identifying different species of plant, then please refer to the section, [recording data by hand](#recording data by hand).

### Recording metadata

Ensure you follow the [metadata](metadata.md) guide, paying particular attention at this point to recording where and when your data and samples were collected. Metadata is most accurate when recorded as soon as possible - don't leave it until the end of your field campaign to make notes.

Remember to digitise this information if you would ordinarily record it in a notebook and treat these files like you would any other data, using secure [storage](storing_data.md) and regular [backups](backing_up_data.md).
