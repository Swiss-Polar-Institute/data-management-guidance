## Data collection from an instrument ####

Wherever data is collected from an instrument, automation and careful setup are key. Much of your setup should already be planned and in place before you begin work in the field. Refer to the [planning](planning_before_go.md) section for what to think about and prepare before you arrive in the field.

#### Handy tips ####

* Unless you have forgotten (or would like to add) a parameter, do not change what is collected in a data file part way through a field campaign. This adds much unneeded complexity and confusion when trying to read the data files during the post-processing stages. In particular, do not change the format of fields or parameter names.

#### Backing up or digitising your data ####

If collecting data in a notebook by hand, it is good practise to digitise the data as soon as possible - ideally this should be done the same day. This gives you firstly a backup of your data in case the unthinkable happens and you lose your notebook. It also means you can embellish any shorthand you have used before you forget what it means, or follow up on anything you needed to query. In particular in cases where you might be recording species observed for example, you can follow up on ID before you forget what your notes referred to.

These data files should then be considered as any other data file: consider the file name, directory structure and backups.

If adding to a data file, with new observations, using the date to denote different versions of the file is helpful eg., project_datatype_observations_YYYYMMDD.csv

### Obtaining data from sample analysis ###

If you are running samples through instrumentation for analysis, consider what works best for you: are you able to have a laptop or computer in the lab, or will you be noting the values by hand?
