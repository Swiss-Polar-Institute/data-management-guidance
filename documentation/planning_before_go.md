# Before you go #
The first step of creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) will lead you through the process of thinking about what data you will collect whilst in the field and how much of it.

Whilst going through this process, think carefully about the following questions:

    - how much data am I planning to collect?
    - do I have enough data storage for the planned data collection, plus extra for unforseen circumstances?
    - do I really understand how big each data file will be?
    - which data do I need to save?
    - how will the data be stored?
    - how will the data be backed-up in the field?
    - how will the files be named?
    - will I be able to access the data during collection?

The sections below will lead you through these and other points in more detail.
