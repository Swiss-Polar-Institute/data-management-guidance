  abstract = {Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531, 889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7\% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2\% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository—rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files—are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8\% of PLOS publications and 12.2\% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36\% (± 1.07\%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their data in repositories. All our data and code are made available in order to reproduce and extend our results.},

  abstract = {Ecological databases continue to grow in volume, breadth and complexity. Higher level descriptions of data (i.e., metadata) and information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses (i.e., “meta-information” in the broadest sense) are essential for understanding and using the increasingly complex and voluminous data and information. The concepts of meta-information, in general, and metadata, in particular, have evolved in concert with the increasing needs for functionality by the community. From a scientific perspective, metadata may be characterized as having developed from initially supporting data discovery; to facilitating acquisition, comprehension and utilization of data by humans; and, most recently, to beginning to enable automated data discovery, ingestion, processing and analysis via metadata-enabled scientific workflow systems. The continued conceptual and operational developments in metadata required to support comprehensive automated scientific workflow systems portend many challenges and opportunities. For example, there are significant opportunities for collaboration among ecologists and computer scientists in developing domain-specific controlled vocabularies and ontologies that provide the basis for semantic mediation—the “glue” technologies that enable automated data discovery, ingestion, processing and analysis. Similarly, there are opportunities for computer scientists and engineers to develop new mechanisms that support automated metadata encoding—such as providing the information that would be necessary to understand the end-to-end flow of sensor data from in situ data collection, streaming through quality assurance filtering, aggregation, transformation and additional processing, analysis, and publication of digital products. As the technologies mature, we still have many sociological barriers to overcome including the needs for increased attention to software usability testing and engineering to enhance user-friendliness of metadata management software, new capital investments in ecological data archives, and increasing the metadata management benefit–cost ratio for the average scientist via incentives and enabling tools.},

Descriptions of the detailed procedures and methods used in trials that have been conducted in the past have generally not been published. As a consequence, those planning such trials have few guidelines available and little access to previously accumulated knowledge. In this book the practical issues of trial design and conduct are discussed fully and in sufficient detail for the text to be used as a "toolbox" by field investigators. The toolbox has now been extensively tested through use of the first two editions and this third edition is a comprehensive revision, incorporating the many developments that have taken place with respect to trials since 1996 and involving more than 30 contributors. Most of the chapters have been extensively revised and 7 new chapters have been added.--},
