## Introduction

### Benefits of good data management

Investment of time in good preparation and management of data files, software, documentation and associated files is an investment for the future. Setting time aside and having a routine for preparing detailed documentation, organising files and doing backups, will make life a lot easier for yourself and others in the future.

### What this guide covers

In this guide we cover good research data management practice with a focus on field work. The first part of the guide is can be applied throughout all stages of the research life cycle. The second part is specifically about data management in the field and is broken into three sections: planning before you go, managing data whilst in the field and a set of priorities for when you get back. 

We regularly refer back to the key sections of the first part of the document and recommend that you are familiar with this before moving on to the second part.

#### Scope

Research data includes raw data directly recorded by hand or from an instrument, processed data which are any files that have been modified, documentation, metadata, supporting data files, code, plots, photographs and any other files associated with the research. 

This guide is applicable to all file types and "kinds" of data. 

We also consider good practice of sample collection from a data management point of view. This section has a particular focus on labelling and collection of metadata about samples.

Finally, we consider field work, and more precisely, polar field work (although the same principles apply anywhere) in the broad sense of not working at your institution. It could be at a field camp, remote operation of an instrument, on a well-established base, on a ship or any other platform, or wherever else you might be taken by your research.

### Further development of this guide

Ongoing development of this document is done in a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Swiss-Polar-Institute/data-management-guidance](https://github.com/Swiss-Polar-Institute/data-management-guidance) and the latest PDF version is published online: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4185227](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4185227). Text is written in Markdown, then [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) is used to convert it to LaTeX and then PDF format. 

We would greatly welcome feedback by way of comments, suggestions, corrections, questions or ideas for further development of this guide.
