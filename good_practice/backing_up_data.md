# Data backup #

Ensuring you have several reliable copies of your data avoids data loss and gives you peace of mind.

Make sure:

    you have at least two, preferably three or more copies of your data;
    that as far as possible, backups are automated. This avoids potential mistakes, minimises the chances of data loss, makes it much easier to do and ensures the backups are always done in the same way.
    your data are backed up on a regular basis during collection, when you have completed data collection and after making any changes;
    your data copies are in different places, eg. institution storage, cloud storage, external hard drives;
    the devices you use are reliable;
    that backed up versions of your data are identical to the primary copy. Whilst checking that files have been copied, even if they are listed in the secondary location, using checksums will confirm they have been copied correctly.

## Documenting backups ##
It is important to document where the files have been backed up, when, how often, as well as how they can be accessed and restored if necessary.
